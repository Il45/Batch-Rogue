# Batch_Rogue
A roguelike made entirely in Batch.

This repository is for "Batch Rogue" a game that I set out making around 2 months ago (march/april 2020).

So far the game includes:
  - Player collision
  - A hardcoded enemy (bad! will eventually change it so it can be read from a single file).
    *note: the enemy reads its variables from the 'entity.txt' file.
  - A few pre-fabricated levels to demonstrate the mechanics.
  - Real time controls (detects keystrokes; not using 'set /p'
